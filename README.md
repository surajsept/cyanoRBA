# cyanoRBA
A coarse-grained biochemical resource allocation model of phototrophic growth.

The framework is developed using Python 3.

****
#### 1. Getting python
You can downlaod the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Alternatively, you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to install python for your computer (Linux, Windows, Mac).

#### 3. Installing the gurobi license
A detailed description of obtaining and installing Gurobi license is given [here](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/retrieving_and_setting_up_.html).   

****
Once you have checked the steps above. You may consider refering to the [Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide). Or, just start a python console to simulate the RBA model of phototrophic growth. 

#### 4. To reproduce plots from the manuscript type the following in your python console:
    run plot_results.py

#### 5. To explore model capabilities:
    run simulation.py
